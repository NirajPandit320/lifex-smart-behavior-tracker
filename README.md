##LifeX – Smart Habit & Expense Tracker

LifeX is a beginner-friendly mobile application built using Flutter & Dart that focuses on understanding daily habits and spending behavior.
The idea behind LifeX is simple: our habits influence our expenses, and this app helps users visualize that connection in an easy and meaningful way.

This project is being developed as part of my own learning like flutter, dart, firebase and many other

1. Why LifeX?

Most expense tracking apps only show numbers.
LifeX goes one step further by combining habit tracking with expense tracking, helping users understand why certain spending patterns occur.

The project is intentionally designed at a beginner level, focusing on:

a.Clean UI

b.Proper app flow

c.Good project structure

d.Easy-to-understand logic

Advanced features will be added gradually as learning progresses.
